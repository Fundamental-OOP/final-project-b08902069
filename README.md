# Final-Project

## Compile & Run

LibGDX actually uses Gradle to manage project. Although there are `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` came with LibGDX, I don't really know what OS you are running on. Thus `make run` will run a premade JAR file.

If you want to use Gradle, use `make run_gradle_linux` or `make run_gradle_windows`.
